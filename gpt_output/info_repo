info about repository:
**faster-whisper** is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, a fast inference engine for Transformer models. It is up to 4 times faster than the original implementation while maintaining the same accuracy and using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU. The repository provides benchmark results comparing the time and memory usage of different implementations for transcribing audio. It includes instructions for installation, usage, and customization of the module. The repository also showcases community integrations and provides a script for model conversion. Contributions to the repository are welcome, and guidelines for installation and validation of changes are provided.
